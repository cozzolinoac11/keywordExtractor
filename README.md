# Keyword Extractor

What Is Keyword Extraction? Keyword extraction (also known as keyword detection or keyword analysis) is a text analysis technique that automatically extracts the most used and most important words and expressions from a text. It helps summarize the content of texts and recognize the main topics discussed.
Every day, internet users create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. Social media comments, product reviews, emails, blog posts, searches, chats, etc. We have all sorts of unstructured textual data. The question is how to sort through this chaos to find what is relevant.
Keyword mining can help you extract the most important keywords or phrases from a given text without having to read a single line.
Whether it's a product manager trying to analyze a stack of product reviews, a customer service manager analyzing customer interactions, or a researcher sifting through hundreds of online documents on a specific topic, you can use keyword mining to easily understand the content of a text.
With keyword extraction, teams can be more efficient and harness the power of data. You can say goodbye to manual and repetitive tasks (saving countless man-hours) and access valuable information that will help you turn unstructured data into valuable knowledge.
